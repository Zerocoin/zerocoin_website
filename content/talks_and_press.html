### Zerocash Paper
#### Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin
##### Eli Ben-Sasson	Alessandro Chiesa Christina Garman Matthew Green 
##### Ian Miers 	Eran Tromer Madars Virza 

> Bitcoin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bitcoin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zerocoin(Miers et al., IEEE S&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment’s origin. Yet, it still reveals payments’ destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality.
> In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs).
> 	First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment’s origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction’s security.Second, we build Zerocash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zerocash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify — orders of magnitude >more efficient than the less-anonymous Zerocoin and competitive with plain Bitcoin.

### Zerocoin Paper
#### Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin
#####Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Aviel D. Rubin
 [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) 2013](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/) | [PDF]({{media_url('pdf/ZerocoinOakland.pdf')}})| Abstract:
> Bitcoin is the ﬁrst e-cash system to see widespread
> adoption. While Bitcoin offers the potential for new types of
> ﬁnancial interaction, it has signiﬁcant limitations regarding
> privacy. Speciﬁcally, because the Bitcoin transaction log is
> completely public, users’ privacy is protected only through 
> the use of pseudonyms. In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a 
> cryptographic extension to Bitcoin  that augments the protocol
> to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system
> uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce
> new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of
> Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin’s cryptographic construction, its
> integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in
>  terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.
